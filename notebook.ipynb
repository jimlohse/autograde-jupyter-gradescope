    "Now let's look at public-key encryption. Despite common misconceptions, it's not inherently more secure than symmetric encryption. It's equally as important as symmetric encryption and represents a major advance in encryption in 2000 years. For public-key encryption, there are separate keys for the sender and recipient. There is a public key and a private key. If the sender encrypts a message with a private key, anyone with the public key can read it and know it came from the sender. Similarly, if you give out your public key, anyone can encrypt a message and know that only you can read it.\n",
